# Product Context: Trello Clone

## Purpose
This Trello clone provides a visual project management tool that helps users organize tasks and projects using the popular kanban board methodology. The implementation serves both as a practical application for users who need simple task management and as a demonstration of front-end development capabilities using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Problems Solved
1. **Task Organization**: Enables users to visually organize tasks across different stages of completion
2. **Project Visualization**: Provides a clear visual representation of project status and progress
3. **Collaboration Interface**: Creates a familiar interface that would support team collaboration (in a full implementation)
4. **Priority Management**: Helps users prioritize work through visual arrangement and labeling

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Create a clean, intuitive UI that requires minimal learning
2. **Smooth Interactions**: Ensure drag-and-drop and other interactions feel natural and responsive
3. **Visual Clarity**: Use color, spacing, and typography to clearly distinguish between boards, lists, and cards
4. **Efficiency**: Design workflows that minimize clicks and make common actions easily accessible
5. **Responsiveness**: Ensure the application works well across all device sizes
6. **Familiarity**: Maintain enough similarity to Trello that users familiar with it will feel comfortable

## Target Users
1. **Individual users** seeking a simple tool for personal task management
2. **Small teams** looking for a visual way to track project progress
3. **Developers and designers** interested in the technical implementation
4. **Students and professionals** who need to organize their work and projects

## Key User Journeys
1. **New User**: Sign up → Create first board → Add lists → Add cards → Organize workflow
2. **Returning User**: Log in → View existing boards → Continue work or create new content
3. **Task Management**: Create a card → Add details/labels → Move between lists as status changes
4. **Project Organization**: Create multiple boards → Organize related tasks → Track progress visually
