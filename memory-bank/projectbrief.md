# Trello Clone Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a front-end implementation of a Trello clone using React and Tailwind CSS. The application will replicate core Trello functionality including boards, lists, cards, and drag-and-drop features while focusing exclusively on the front-end with localStorage for data persistence.

## Core Requirements
1. Create a responsive single-page application that mimics Trello's core functionality
2. Implement user authentication UI (mock functionality using localStorage)
3. Allow users to create, view, edit, and delete boards
4. Enable creation and management of lists within boards
5. Support card creation, editing, and movement between lists
6. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for cards and lists
7. Add labeling and color-coding for cards
8. Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes

## Technical Constraints
- Front-end only implementation (no backend integration)
- Use React for the front-end framework
- Implement styling with Tailwind CSS
- Store data in localStorage for persistence
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Focus on responsive and intuitive UI

## Success Criteria
- Users can perform all CRUD operations on boards, lists, and cards
- Drag-and-drop functionality works smoothly
- Authentication flow (login/signup) is implemented in the UI
- Data persists between browser sessions via localStorage
- UI is responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
