# Active Context: Trello Clone

## Current Focus
We are implementing a Trello clone front-end using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. We have completed the project setup, authentication UI, board management, list/card functionality, drag-and-drop features, responsive design, dark mode, and implemented a global label management system. Our next focus is testing and optimization.

## Recent Decisions
1. **Component Architecture**: Created modular components for lists and cards with their own state management
2. **Modal Implementation**: Implemented a modal for detailed card editing
3. **Label Management**: Upgraded to a global label management system with persistent labels across cards
4. **Data Structure**: Established relationships between boards, lists, and cards in localStorage, storing label IDs in cards
5. **UI Design**: Using consistent styling for components with proper responsive behavior
6. **Drag and Drop**: Implemented drag-and-drop using react-beautiful-dnd for improved user experience
7. **Theme Support**: Added dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
8. **Responsive Layout**: Implemented responsive designs for all components across device sizes

## Current Status
The project is in the implementation phase. We have:
- Set up the project with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Created authentication UI with login and signup forms
- Implemented mock authentication flow
- Completed board management features (create, edit, delete)
- Implemented lists with CRUD operations
- Added cards with editing functionality via a modal
- Implemented global label management system with persistent labels
- Added drag-and-drop functionality for reordering lists and moving cards
- Implemented dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- Made the application responsive across all device sizes

## Next Steps
1. Set up testing framework and write unit tests
2. Test application across different browsers
3. Optimize performance for mobile devices
4. Improve accessibility for keyboard navigation
5. Fix any remaining bugs or edge cases

## Active Considerations
1. **Performance**: Monitor drag-and-drop operations on mobile devices
2. **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Data Consistency**: Maintain consistent state between UI and localStorage
4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for edge cases
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test theme switching and drag-and-drop functionality across browsers
6. **Label Management**: Ensure proper migration of existing card labels to the new system
