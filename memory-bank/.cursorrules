# Trello Clone Project Rules

## Project Preferences
- Use React functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling over CSS/SCSS files
- Use TypeScript for type safety where possible
- Follow a component-first approach to development
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design throughout

## Coding Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables)
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Organize imports with React/library imports first, then components, then utilities
- Use destructuring for props and state

## File Organization
- Group related components in folders
- Keep styles with components (no separate CSS files)
- Use index.js/ts files for clean imports
- Use barrel exports for component directories

## State Management
- Use React Context API for global state
- Use localStorage for persistence
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

## Component Patterns
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement UI components as presentational when possible
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when necessary

## Documentation
- Use JSDoc comments for component props and functions
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep the Memory Bank updated as implementation progresses
- Include responsive considerations in component documentation

## User Interface
- Follow Trello's familiar interface patterns
- Use subtle animations for improved UX
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper hover/focus states
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for accessibility

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px
