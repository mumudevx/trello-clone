# Summary

The Trello Clone application in the this repository was created to test the capabilities of the cursor memory mechanism and the process was continued entirely on the cursor with Claude 3.7 sonnet thinking LLM.

According to my examinations, although the project brief and technical brief documents that I created the framework for before are more detailed than the memory mechanism, the current mechanism can also do very good project planning, run the process smoothly and do coding.

My future plan may be to combine my own project planning framework with the memory mechanism and turn it into an MCP server.
